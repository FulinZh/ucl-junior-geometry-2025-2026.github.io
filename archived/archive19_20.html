      <p class="speaker-info">Speaker: Lucía Martín Merchán</p>
      <p class="abstract-info">Abstract: An orbifold is a space which is locally modelled on balls of the   euclidean space quotient by a finite group. These have been very useful   in many geometrical contexts; in the setting of symplectic geometry,   symplectic orbifolds have been introduced mainly as a way to construct   symplectic manifolds by resolving their singularities. Some authors have   provided methods for resolving particular types of symplectic orbifold   singularities; but there are no techniques to resolve general symplectic   orbifolds. <br />
      In this talk we give a method to resolve arbitrary   symplectic 4-orbifolds making use of techniques of resolution of   quotient singularities and gluing symplectic forms. This is a joint work   with J. Rojo.</p></td>

      <p class="abstract-info">Abstract: Spin(7) manifolds are Ricci flat 8-dimensional Riemannian   manifolds. Together with G2, they form the class of exceptional holonomy   manifolds. The first examples were constructed by Bryant and Salamon in   1989 and since then many more have appeared, though very few explicit.   In this talk, I will describe a method of finding many explicit   local examples of Spin(7) metrics admitting 2-torus actions such that   the quotient 6-manifolds are Kähler. The key ingredients will be the   symplectic reduction and the Gibbons-Hawking ansatz. The talk will be   non-technical and I will give a comprehensive background.</p></td>

After introducing a Dirac type operator we will prove a result  on the cohomology of nearly G_2 manifolds. Along the way we will reprove a result of Alexandrov—Semmelman on the space of infinitesimal deformation of nearly G_2 structures. Finally we will discuss the progress so far for the second order deformations. This is all a joint work with Shubham Dwivedi (University of Waterloo).</p></td>

      <p class="abstract-info">Abstract: An 8-dimensional Riemannian manifold with holonomy group contained in Spin(7) is Ricci-flat, but not Kahler. The condition that the holonomy reduces to Spin(7) is equivalent to a complicated system of non-linear PDEs. In the non-compact setting, symmetries can be used to reduce this complexity. In the case of cohomogeneity one manifolds, i.e. where a generic orbit has codimension one, the non-linear PDE system reduces to a nonlinear ODE system. I will discuss examples where existence questions of Spin(7) holonomy metrics give rise to an interesting problem for ODE systems.</p></td>

      <p class="abstract-info">Abstract: $G_2$-instantons in 7-dim are analogous to ASD-instantons in 4-dim; this motivates the idea of using $G_2$-instantons to construct enumerative invariants of $G_2$-manifolds. Therefore it is natural to search for examples of $G_2$-instantons on all known constructions of $G_2$-manifolds. This becomes easier when the manifolds have a high level of symmetry. In this talk, we consider $G_2$-manifolds which have a cohomogeneity one action of $SU(2)^2\times U(1)$, while also being asymptotically conical. We will discuss the progress that has been made to find instantons on these manifolds.</p></td>

      <p class="abstract-info">Abstract: When is an element $g\in G$ of a group a product of commutators $[a,b]$? What is the minimal number of commutators $n$ such that $g=[a_1,b_1]\cdots[a_n,b_n]$? What are all possible solutions $(a_1,b_1,\dots,a_m,b_m)$ to the equation $g=[a_1,b_1]\cdots[a_m,b_m]$? Very difficult, yet important, questions --- but ones whose answers seem to lie in the darkest recesses of combinatorial group theory. </p>
      <p class="abstract-info">Not so! At least for $G$ a free group, these questions can all be answered elegantly and beautifully by cutting up and colouring surfaces. In this talk I shall present solutions to these problems with an emphasis on drawing nice pictures. </p></td>

      <p class="abstract-info">Abstract: Geodesics on a Riemannian manifold encode crucial information about its geometry such as the curvature. The same is true for the higher dimensional analogue of geodesics: minimal surfaces. On a manifold with special holonomy, there is distinguished class of minimal submanifolds, called calibrated submanifolds. The hope is that the space of calibrated submanifolds contains even finer information about the ambient manifold, potentially leading to new invariants. In this talk, we will review some basic results of calibrated geometry and then go on and see in which geometries the space of deformations of a calibrated submanifold is automatically smooth and compute its dimension.</p></td>

I will explain what this category is and provide motivation for why it is useful. After this I will cover some basic properties and results, finally I will explain one technique, semiorthogonal decompositions, that is used to study them. In the special case of projective space this will provide a connection with quiver algebras.

Then we will pass to the more general problem, see what can go wrong even in the class of graphs and motivate ourselves to work with a more general class of surfaces, suitable for establishing existence. We finish this talk with Allard's regularity theorem  for area minimizers , relating it with the PDE approach in the begining.

Whether you are working in algebraic geometry or differential geometry, if your scheme/manifold is not smooth you may have some troubles. When working with derived categories, one finds out that the singularities of a scheme are captured by the difference between perfect complexes and bounded complexes. However, understanding how distant Perf(X) and D^b(X) are is not always an easy task to accomplish. In this talk I will survey the topics mentioned above and introduce the category of  matrix factorizations.</p></td>

These are the so-called cohomogeneity-one manifolds, and there are many examples of them. The large degree of symmetry is useful when we consider cohomogeneity-one Riemannian manifolds, with isometric K-actions: cohomogeneity-one metrics have given rise to many examples of Riemannian metrics satisfying special properties e.g. Ricci flat, nearly Kahler. We will see examples, sketch some basic theory, and discuss applications.</p></td>

      <p class="abstract-info">Abstract: A Kähler manifold carries Riemannian, complex and symplectic structures, which are compatible in a certain way. Hyper-Kähler manifolds carry a Riemannian structure, plus three complex structures (and symplectic forms) which satisfy the quaternionic relations. In particular, they are Kähler in three (and, in fact, infinitely many) ways, and their tangent spaces are quaternionic. They can also be viewed as having a holomorphic symplectic structure. This can be used to define a quotient of the manifold by a group that preserves the hyper-Kähler structure, in a way analogous to symplectic reduction for symplectic manifolds (or the closely related GIT quotient for Kähler manifolds). We will review symplectic reduction and define hyper-Kähler manifolds and reduction, and will end by show some examples.

Although they rarely provides rigorous demonstrations, drawings and pictures are essential in building our intuition. In this opening seminar we will discuss some techniques to visualize complex algebraic varieties.

      <p class="abstract-info">Abstract: Complex simple Lie groups are groups of matrices that behave in a similar fashion to the group SL_n(C) of n x n complex matrices of determinant 1. They are classified up to isogeny by a short list of simple graphs, called Dynkin diagrams. In an apparently unrelated theorem, the very same graphs also classify a particular class of singularities on complex algebraic surfaces, called du Val singularities. In this talk, I will briefly explain these two classification theorems. I will then explain how this mysterious combinatorial coincidence is realised directly as a special case of Springer theory, which gives a general method for producing singularities (and resolutions of them) from Lie groups. Time permitting, I will also explain some of the deeper aspects of this correspondence, such as the representation theory hidden within the singularities and resolutions of Springer theory.</p>

      <p class="speaker-info">Speaker: Navid Nabijou</p>
      <p class="abstract-info">Abstract: The cohomology of a smooth algebraic variety X comes equipped with a cup product. If we are given two smooth subvarieties of X, then each of them defines a Poincare dual cohomology class. The cup product of these classes can then be interpreted (under Poincare duality) as a “transverse intersection” of the subvarieties we started with. This makes sense even if the original varieties did not happen to intersect transversely.  This notion - of transverse or “generic” intersection - is ubiquitous in algebraic geometry. It forms the cornerstone of modern enumerative geometry, and is central to fields as diverse as birational geometry and the theory of motives. For various reasons, the usual cohomology ring is not well-suited for the aforementioned applications. To start with, it does not behave well for singular varieties, or for varieties defined over fields other than the complex numbers. More crucially, it does not provide a way to construct so-called “refined intersection products”. In this talk I will explain, by means of examples, what the term “refined intersection product” means, and why constructing one is so important and useful. I will then explain the algebro-geometric construction of Fulton-MacPherson, and give some example applications. </p>

We will then construct the corresponding derived categories and see how they greatly simplify many `scary' concepts, like Tors, Exts, spectral sequences and so on.

In 1953 Berger gave a classification of all groups which can be the holonomy group of irreducible and nonsymmetric Riemannian metrics. Two of the groups in the classification, G2 and Spin(7), have been termed the exceptional holonomy groups as metrics with these holonomy groups are particularly hard to find. I will give a thorough introduction to these two groups.</p>

It studies Lefschetz fibrations: smooth proper maps from smooth oriented 2n-manifolds to the complex numbers which have finitely many isolated and non-degenerate critical points. Just like in Morse Theory, interesting things happen to the fibres of these maps near the critical values that we can use to deduce interesting things about our original manifold. And what's more, it turns out that Picard-Lefschetz Theory is, in some sense, essentially a symplectic phenomenon. In this talk, I'll introduce you to Lefschetz fibrations and show you some reasons why they are so very useful in Symplectic Geometry.</p>

A singularity of the hypersurface f = 0 is "simple" if we only get finitely many equivalence classes of singularities when changing the coefficients of f slightly. I will give a proof of the classical result that simple singularities are precisely the ADE-singularities, which are Du Val singularities in the surface case.</p>

In this talk, we introduce it and try to understand something more about its properties. We see how some of its algebraic properties are closely related to many interesting geometric problems. For instance, if the class of the affine line was not a zero-divisor in this ring, it was possible to conclude that the cubic fourfold was rational. Moreover, if this was not enough, we present further geometric reasons to motivate the interest in it. After we have risen your hope that this may actually prove some conjectures, we show that the class of the affine line is a zero-divisor in the Grothendieck ring. Hopefully, even after this shocking revelation, your life will continue as usual; but you will know why this ring is something to be scared of.</p>

      <p class="abstract-info">Abstract: For a smooth projective curve,  the varieties parametrising its secant planes are among the most studied objects in classical enumerative geometry.  In order to better understand their geometry, which in turn describes the extrinsic properties of the curve, one is lead to the study of Brill-Noether theory.  This allows us to translate such extrinsic geometry problems in terms of objects belonging to the intrinsic geometry of the curve, namely subvarieties of its symmetric product.  In this talk we shall introduce some basic notions of Brill-Noether theory, define secant varieties to a curve embedded in projective space and study some unexpected properties of their geometry that arise as non-transversality of intersections inside the symmetric product of the curve.</p>

      <p class="speaker-info">Speaker: Johnny Nicholson</p>
      <p class="abstract-info">Abstract: In the 1980s Freedman and Quinn showed that techniques from high-dimensional topology, such as surgery theory and the s-cobordism theorem, can be made to work for topological 4-manifolds. Whilst these techniques can be used to classify simply-connected topological 4-manifolds, similar results in the non-simply connected case are few and far between. This is largely due to the mystery surrounding the second homotopy group \pi_2(M) which has the structure of a \Z[\pi_1(M)] module. In this talk, we will give an overview of two approaches to the classification of 4-manifolds using techniques from high-dimensional topology.
The first approach is to start by classifying up to homotopy and then to use classical surgery to classify up to homeomorphism within each homotopy type. Whilst a clean homotopy classification can often be obtained, the second step throws up obstructions which can only be computed for a small class of groups.
The second approach, which also works for smooth 4-manifolds, is to first classify up to connected sum with S^2 \times S^2 using Kreck’s modified surgery and then to deal with the cancellation of the (S^2 \times S^2)-summands separately. In the 1990s, Hambleton and Kreck explored the connection between this cancellation problem and the problem of cancellation of a free summand in a \Z[\pi_1(M)] module and the cancellation of a wedge with S^2 in a finite two-complex. This led to a complete classification of topological 4-manifolds with cyclic or odd-order fundamental group.
I will report on recent progress made on the cancellation problem for modules and complexes, and will discuss a current project to extend the known examples of non-cancellation for manifolds, i.e. examples of 4-manifolds M and N for which M \# (S^2 \times S^2) = N \# (S^2 \times S^2) but for which M and N are not even homotopic.</p>

We review the study on rotationally symmetric manifolds done by Angenent and Isenberg as well as by Isenberg, Knopf and Sesum. In the latter, a global frame for the tangent bundle, called the Milnor frame, was used to set up the problem. We shall look at the symmetries of the manifold, derived from Lie groups and its ansatz metrics, and this global tangent bundle frame developed by Milnor and Bianchi. Numerical simulations of the Ricci flow on these manifolds are done, following the work by Garfinkle  and Isenberg, providing insight and conjectures for the main problem. Some analytic results will be proven for the manifolds S1×S3 and S4 using maximum principles from parabolic PDE theory and some sufficiency conditions for a neckpinch singularity will be provided. Finally, a problem from general relativity with similar metric symmetries but endowed on a manifold with different topology, the Taub-Bolt and Taub-Nut metrics, will be discussed.</p>

      <p class="abstract-info">Abstract: It is well known that the space of stability conditions of a triangulated category is a complex manifold. In fact, mirror symmetry predicts that this space carries a richer geometric structure: that of a Frobenius manifold. From a quiver, one can construct a sequence of triangulated categories which are indexed by the integers. It is then natural to study the stability manifolds of these categories, and in particular to consider any changes to the manifolds as the integer indexing the triangulated category varies. We will study this construction for the Kronecker quiver, and discuss how the results provide evidence for a Frobenius structure on these stability manifolds</p>

These moduli problems generate novel geometric structures, too. In this talk we shall see an illustrated study of moduli spaces of generic Morse-Smale flows, with a brief introduction to theories of manifolds with strange corners (so-called analytical corners in particular), and a new result on linearizing certain vector fields (analytical Morse's Lemma). </p>

      <p class="abstract-info">Abstract: This talk will discuss learning and processing with structured data. Structured data appears in many applications: the pixels of an image are structured by a grid, weather measurements are structured by the Earth's geometry, the atoms of a molecule are structured by chemical forces, economic and demographic indicators are structured by transportation networks. Graphs will be our preferred representation of structure. We will start with the modeling of sampled manifolds by graphs, and see how the graph Laplacian converges to the Laplace-Beltrami. As an example, we'll consider the classification of cosmological observations on the sphere. We'll then move on to purely discrete domains, where the absence of a strong theory leaves freedom in the design of computational operations. After the reinterpretation of our Laplacian-based tool in a more general framework, the passing and aggregation of information across vertices, we will see some alternative formulations. As an example we'll consider the classification of scientific papers given their content and relations, defined by a citation network. </p>
