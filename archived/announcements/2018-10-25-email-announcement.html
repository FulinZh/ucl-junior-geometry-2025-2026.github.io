<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>The coming KCL/UCL Junior Geometry Seminar will be held on Thursday at UCL. <span style="color:#dc672d">Please note that the starting time is 5 pm, and also note the room change (it is now D103 in the UCL maths building).</span> Here are the details about the talk:</p>
<p style="padding: 0; margin: 10px; font-weight: bold;">Title: Introduction to Intersection Theory</p>
<p style="padding: 0; margin: 10px; color: #dc672d;">Speaker: Navid Nabijou</p>
<p style="padding: 0; margin: 0; font-weight: bold;">Thu 25.10.18</p>
    <p style="padding: 0; margin: 0;">17.00-18.00</p>
        <p class="location-info"> Location: UCL Maths D103

      <p style="padding: 10px; margin: 0; display: block">Abstract: The cohomology of a smooth algebraic variety X comes equipped with a cup product. If we are given two smooth subvarieties of X, then each of them defines a Poincare dual cohomology class. The cup product of these classes can then be interpreted (under Poincare duality) as a “transverse intersection” of the subvarieties we started with. This makes sense even if the original varieties did not happen to intersect transversely. This notion - of transverse or “generic” intersection - is ubiquitous in algebraic geometry. It forms the cornerstone of modern enumerative geometry, and is central to fields as diverse as birational geometry and the theory of motives. For various reasons, the usual cohomology ring is not well-suited for the aforementioned applications. To start with, it does not behave well for singular varieties, or for varieties defined over fields other than the complex numbers. More crucially, it does not provide a way to construct so-called “refined intersection products”. In this talk I will explain, by means of examples, what the term “refined intersection product” means, and why constructing one is so important and useful. I will then explain the algebro-geometric construction of Fulton-MacPherson, and give some example applications.   </p>

<p>We are also happy to announce that various snacks will be available. We are looking forward to see many of you there. Information about the talks can also be found on our seminar website: www.nms.kcl.ac.uk/daniel.platt/junior-geometry.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
