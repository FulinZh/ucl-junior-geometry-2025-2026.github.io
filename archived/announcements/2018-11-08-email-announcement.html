    <p style="padding: 10px; margin: 0; display: block">Abstract: Geometric group theory aims to study groups using tools from geometry and topology, more precisely to study finitely generated groups by looking at the way they act on geometric and topological spaces. In this talk I shall introduce some of the aims of geometric group theory, and construct a well-known space associated to a finitely presented group. I will talk about algebraic splittings of groups in the sense of van Kampen's Theorem, and finish by sketching the proof of Dunwoody's theorem that finitely presented groups admit only a finite number of such splittings over finite subgroups.   </p>
      <p style="padding: 0; margin: 0;">Keywords: geometric group theory; fundamental group, finitely presented group, accessibility of groups; simplicial complex; group action</p>
      
<p>We are also happy to announce that a small number of snacks will be available. We are looking forward to see many of you there. Information about the talks can also be found on our seminar website: www.nms.kcl.ac.uk/daniel.platt/junior-geometry.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>Kristina and Daniel</p>
