    <p style="padding: 10px; margin: 0; display: block">Abstract: Derived categories were discovered by Grothendieck and Verdier in 1960s and have since then became an ubiquitous tool in homological algebra and its applications to algebraic geometry, number theory, and other parts of mathematics. This talk will be a gentle introduction to the subject, based on lots of examples and very few proofs. We will start by overviewing the basics of categories, concentrating on our main examples: modules over a ring and coherent sheaves over a variety. We will then construct the corresponding derived categories and see how they greatly simplify many `scary' concepts, like Tors, Exts, spectral sequences and so on. If time permits, we will also explore how the geometry of a variety is encoded within its derived category. No prior knowledge of categories or derived functors is necessary!    </p>
      <p style="padding: 0; margin: 0;">Keywords: derived categories, derived functors, duality, cohomology, spectral sequence, birational geometry, canonical bundle, six functors</p>
      
<p>We are also happy to announce that various snacks will be available. We are looking forward to see many of you there. Information about the talks can also be found on our seminar website: www.nms.kcl.ac.uk/daniel.platt/junior-geometry.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>Kristina and Daniel</p>
