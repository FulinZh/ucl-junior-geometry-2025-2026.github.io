<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>The coming KCL/UCL Junior Geometry Seminar will be held on Thursday at UCL.<span style="color: #dc672d"> </span>Here are the details about the talk:</p>
<p style="padding: 0; margin: 10px; font-weight: bold;">Title: A taste of categorical geometry</p>
<p style="padding: 0; margin: 10px; color: #dc672d;">Speaker: Bradley Doyle</p>
<p style="padding: 0; margin: 0; font-weight: bold;">Thu 02.05.19</p>
    <p style="padding: 0; margin: 0;">17.00-18.00</p>
        <p class="location-info"> Location: UCL, Gordon Street 25, Room: Maths 505
    <p class="location-info"><a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/junior-geometry/teaser-pictures/2019-05-02/full-size.jpg"><img src="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/junior-geometry/teaser-pictures/2019-05-02/full-size.jpg" width="200" /></a></p>
    <p style="padding: 10px; margin: 0; display: block">Abstract: I will aim to give a brief overview of two connected ideas related to algebraic geometry and category theory. First I will give an informal description of a derived category and introduce semiorthogonal decompositions. I will give a few examples as well as mentioning some of the main results. Then I will talk about categorical or noncommutative resolutions. Kuznetsov showed a connection between categorical resolutions and semiorthogonal decompositions which I will explain. Time permitting I will finish by mentioning noncommutative resolutions for quotients by reductive groups. </p>
      <p style="padding: 0; margin: 0;">Keywords: algebraic geometry, category theory, derived category, semiorthogonal decomposition, noncommutative resolution </p>

<p>We are also happy to announce that various snacks will be available. We are looking forward to see many of you there. Information about the talks can also be found on our seminar website: www.ucl.ac.uk/junior-geometry.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>Kristina and Daniel</p>
