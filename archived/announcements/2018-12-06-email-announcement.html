    <p style="padding: 10px; margin: 0; display: block">Abstract: Picard-Lefschetz Theory (the complex analogue of Morse Theory) was first invented for complex surfaces by Emile Picard, then generalized to higher dimensions by Solomon Lefschetz (who by the way had no hands). It studies Lefschetz fibrations: smooth proper maps from smooth oriented 2n-manifolds to the complex numbers which have finitely many isolated and non-degenerate critical points. Just like in Morse Theory, interesting things happen to the fibres of these maps near the critical values that we can use to deduce interesting things about our original manifold. And what's more, it turns out that Picard-Lefschetz Theory is, in some sense, essentially a symplectic phenomenon. In this talk, I'll introduce you to Lefschetz fibrations and show you some reasons why they are so very useful in Symplectic Geometry.  </p>
      <p style="padding: 0; margin: 0;">Keywords: symplectic geometry, Lefschetz fibration, monodromy, Dehn twist, vanishing cycle </p>

<p>We are also happy to announce that various snacks will be available. We are looking forward to see many of you there. Information about the talks can also be found on our seminar website: www.ucl.ac.uk/junior-geometry.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
