      <p style="padding: 10px; margin: 0; display: block">Abstract: Complex simple Lie groups are groups of matrices that behave in a similar fashion to the group SL_n(C) of n x n complex matrices of determinant 1. They are classified up to isogeny by a short list of simple graphs, called Dynkin diagrams. In an apparently unrelated theorem, the very same graphs also classify a particular class of singularities on complex algebraic surfaces, called du Val singularities. In this talk, I will briefly explain these two classification theorems. I will then explain how this mysterious combinatorial coincidence is realised directly as a special case of Springer theory, which gives a general method for producing singularities (and resolutions of them) from Lie groups. Time permitting, I will also explain some of the deeper aspects of this correspondence, such as the representation theory hidden within the singularities and resolutions of Springer theory.  </p>

<p>We are also happy to announce that various snacks will be available. We are looking forward to see many of you there. Information about the talks can also be found on our seminar website: <a href="www.nms.kcl.ac.uk/daniel.platt/junior-geometry">www.nms.kcl.ac.uk/daniel.platt/junior-geometry</a>.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
