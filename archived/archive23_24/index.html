                        We will define an ideal triangulation of a three-manifold and build the shape variety of this three-manifold 
                        with this ideal triangulation.
                        Throughout this talk we will use the example of the figure-eight knot complement, drawing an ideal triangulation 
                        of this three-manifold and defining its shape variety.

                        From the real locus of the shape variety, we will explore two conjectures.

                        First, we will look at taut triangulations and find that some lie on the real locus, and others do not. By 
                        looking at the special properties of the taut triangulations that do not lie on the real locus, we explain 
                        the conjecture: triangulations on the real locus are flexible.

                        We then look at representations of the knot group that coincide with points on the real locus of the shape
                        variety. We will see some loops have images in PSL(2,\RR), others in PSL(2,\CC), and explore a conjecture 
                        relating when the image of the representation itself is a subgroup of PSL(2,\RR) or PSL(2,\CC).

                        It is well-known that the kernel of the graph Laplacian captures the topological properties 
                        (number of cycles and connected components) of a graph. In a similar fashion, the kernel of 
                        a persistent Laplacian captures the information contained in the persistent homology of a 
                        given simplicial complex. Our main goal is to understand what we can deduce from the remaining 
                        eigenvalues and -vectors in the more general cellular sheaf setting, which theoretically 
                        incorporate further information of the faces of a simplicial complex. In this talk, I will 
                        discuss work in progress towards this aim and present a recently-established theoretical 
                        foundation for this goal, where we show that the eigenvalues are stable under small perturbation 
                        of the sheaf and simplicial complex. The upshot of this result is that we can reasonably assume 
                        that the additional information encoded by the other eigenvalues and -vectors are a faithful 
                        representation of other geometric or topological properties of the underlying simplicial complex, 
                        although precisely what this information represents remains to be investigated (current work in 
                        progress proceeds with a machine learning approach). Joint work with Shiv Bhatia, Daniel Ruiz 
                        Cifuentes and Anthea Monod.

                        Conical symplectic singularities and their crepant resolutions play a starring role in the 
                        theory of symplectic duality, pertaining to 3-D mirror symmetry. Examples of conical symplectic 
                        singularities include: Kleinian singularities. $\CC^{2n}/\Gamma$, for $\Gamma\subseteq \mathrm{Sp}(2n)$ 
                        (affine) Nakajima quiver varieties. We discuss an application of GIT techniques developed by 
                        Arzantev-Derental-Hausen-Laface to the construction of crepant resolutions of conical symplectic 
                        singularities. We will present our recent result classifying and enumerating all crepant resolutions

                        novelty of our result lies in the construction of all the non-projective crepant resolutions of $\MM_n(0)$.

                        The expansion of the universe and singular spacetimes were both remarkable predictions of general relativity. Many cosmological spacetimes model the expanding universe, such as FLRW, Kasner and de Sitter spacetimes. The study of Big Bang-type singularities and the future and past stability of these metrics have been a highly active area of mathematical research.
                        After a brief introduction, we explain some of the classical results regarding the Big Bang singularities. In particular, we explain and compare Hawking's Incompleteness Theorem with its Riemannian analogue, the Bonnet–Myers theorem. Additionally, we will delve into more recent works on the singularity's stability and future stability, and outline some of the tools required to prove these results.

                    <div class="speaker">Aleksandra Bozovic, LSGNT</div>

                    <div class="abstract">
                        The Mandelbrot set is possibly one of the most famous images in mathematics, 
                        and is even popular outside of mathematics due to its striking visual qualities, 
                        in particular its self-similarity. It originates from complex or holomorphic 
                        dynamics, a field which studies iterated holomorphic maps, and in particular from 
                        the study of the quadratic family $\{z\mapsto z^{2}+c|c\in \mathbb{C}\}$, which can 
                        be considered a step up in complexity after the Möbius maps, whose dynamics are 
                        easily classified), yet still, many open questions remain surrounding its 
                        properties. In this talk, I shall give an introduction to the dynamics 
                        of rational maps in one dimension in general, with a particular focus on the 
                        quadratic family. Next, I shall explain one aspect of the Mandelbrot set's 
                        self-similarity, the existence of little Mandelbrot copies, homeomorphic to the 
                        Mandelbrot set itself, through the theory of quadratic-like renormalization. Broadly 
                        speaking, renormalization in dynamics is the phenomenon where restricting the 
                        iterates of elements of a family of maps to a subset of their domains again gives 
                        us a map in the same family (up to an appropriate conjugation), called the 
                        renormalization, which can be used to study the original map.  In the end, I shall 
                        present some conjectures and open questions related to the Mandelbrot set and discuss 
                        how they are related to quadratic-like renormalization.

                    The regularity theories of Schoen--Simon--Yau and Schoen--Simon for stable minimal hypersurfaces are 
                    foundational in geometric analysis. Using this regularity theory, in low dimensions, 
                    Chodosh--Ketover--Maximo and Buzano--Sharp studied singularity formation in sequences of minimal 
                    hypersurfaces through a bubble analysis.

                    I will review this background, before talking about my recent work in this bubble analysis theory. 
                    In particular I will show how to obtain upper semicontinuity of index plus nullity along a bubble 
                    converging sequence of minimal hypersurfaces. The strategy we employ is inspired by recent 
                    developments in the bubbling theory of harmonic maps by DaLio--Gianocca-Rivière.

                    In some settings, you cannot say very much. Given an arbitrary

                    FJRW theory is an enumerative curve count for Landau-Ginzburg models. Analogous to Gromov-Witten theory for Calabi-Yau or Fano varieties,
                    there is a mirror to FJRW theory that has become known as Saito-Givental theory. In this talk, I will motivate Saito-Givental theory by 
                    describing closed r-spin intersection numbers as the simplest example of FJRW theory. I will then explain closed Saito-Givental theory

                    The study of Higgs bundles on an algebraic curve originated from Hitchin's work on the self-dual Yang Mills equations but have
                    connections to a vast array of topics in differential and algebraic geometry (and even number theory). If vector
                    bundles can be thought of as global analogues of vector spaces, Higgs bundles can be thought of as global analogues
                    of linear endomorphisms. The Hitchin fibration on the moduli space of Higgs bundles is defined using the characteristic
                    polynomial, and is a key tool in the study of this space. The Hitchin fibres can be described via the spectral correspondence
                    which relate Higgs bundles on the curve to rank 1 sheaves on its spectral cover; this is in effect a diagonalisation process.
                    <br><br>
                    There is also a notion of Higgs bundles associated to a real group G. In the case that G is quasi-split, there is a

                    correspondences have also been calculated for a number of non-quasi-split cases, all of which exhibit behaviour which is in a
                    certain sense 'non-abelian'. I will give a spectral correspondence for the group G=U(p,q), building on the descriptions

                    In introductory algebraic geometry courses, mathematics students are typically shown how to desingularise a cone by blowing up its singular point. If you have ever done this by hand and you did not find it too hard, consider now the challenge of doing this not just once, but 16 times!
                    <br><br>
                    In this talk, I will showcase how we can blow-up singularities in a "smarter" way, by explaining the theory that allow us to desingularise Kummer surfaces. These are K3 surfaces with 16 nodes that arise as quotients of Abelian surfaces and, besides having a very interesting birational geometry, they also have applications in number theory, as they allow us to find rational points on genus 2 curves. 
                    <br><br>
                    This talk will provide a nice introduction to the theory of algebraic surfaces and their singularities through an example, but I also intend to mention my contributions to this topic, by describing how Kummer surfaces behave when we work over a field of characteristic 2 and explaining what we can say about their desingularisation in that case.

                    The SYZ conjecture is a geometric way of understanding mirror symmetry via the existence
                    of dual special Lagrangian fibrations on mirror Calabi-Yau manifolds. Motivated by
                    this conjecture, it is expected that G<sub>2</sub> and Spin(7)-manifolds
                    admit calibrated fibrations as well. After giving a quick introduction to the world of calibrated

                    of singular fibres. On the way we talk about the deformation theory of compact and conical Cayley submanifolds

Two undesirable issues can happen in the limit: the points might approach D, or collide into each other. If we forget the divisor D and consider the space of n distinct points on X, then the issue of colliding points has been resolved by Fulton and MacPherson (1994) with their Fulton—MacPherson configuration spaces.

                    In this talk, I am going to explain how one can compactify the configuration space in two steps – first using logarithmic geometry to resolve the first issue (resulting in an intermediate space (X|D)^n), then lifting the Fulton—MacPherson compactification to this setting to separate the points, giving the space FM_n(X|D). I will describe a combinatorial stratification of both spaces, as well as some potential applications of this project.

                            homology of a topological space X (denoted H^i(X) ) counts the 'i-dimensional holes' 
                            in your topological space X. This (co)homology theory already lets us prove some pretty 
                            cool topology theorems, such as the Brower fixed point theorem, the Hairy ball theorem, 
                            and the Borsuk Ulam Theorem. Maybe I'll discuss the proof of one of these.

                            There are other homology theories you're going to come across during the topics courses, 
                            such as de Rham and sheaf, so time permitting I'll mention these and how they're 
                            related to the others.

                        An important fact in elementary symplectic topology is that symplectic structures have no local invariants.
                        This manifests in Darboux's theorem (all symplectic manifolds locally look the same), Moser's stability theorem
                        (perturbing a symplectic form within its cohomology class does not change its diffeomorphic type), Weinstein's Lagrangian neighbourhood theorem
                        (a neighbourhood of Lagrangian submanifold L looks like a neighbourhood of the zero section in the cotangent
                        bundle of L), and more.

                        All this theorems can be proved using a simple argument, called Moser's trick, stating that
                        families of symplectic forms with exact derivative come from families of diffeomorphisms.
                        We will prove Moser's trick and then deduce (some of) the theorems above from it.

                        The mapping class group of a manifold is the group of isotopy classes of its automorphisms; this has been widely studied in many contexts and has connections to almost every field in pure mathematics. In the 1970's, now-classic work by Birman and Hilden established a way to study mapping class groups using branched covers of the manifold, leading to beautiful and unexpected results in the theory of representations of braid groups.

All necessary background will be defined in the talk and there will be many pictures.
