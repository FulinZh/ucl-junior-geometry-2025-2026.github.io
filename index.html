        <p>The KCL/UCL Junior Geometry Seminar is a joint seminar of King's
        College London and University College London, presenting topics from
        Algebraic Geometry, Differential Geometry, Geometric Analysis, Geometric
        Group Theory, Topology, and related areas.</p>

        <p>The target audience is young researchers — in particular PhD
        students — with the goal of being <i>useful</i> to those that attend.
        Talks can be introductory, or more advanced. The seminar will take place
        in person at KCL, on <b>Tuesdays from
        16:00 to 17:00 BST</b>. 
        If you would like to see a particular topic, or
        give a talk, please email one of the organizers:

                    We consider quotient singularities V/G, where V is a
                    finite-dimensional vector space and G is a finite subgroup
                    of SL(V). V/G has a canonical bundle K, and a resolution of
                    singularities f:Y->V/G is crepant if f*K is isomorphic to
                    the canonical bundle on Y. Crepant resolutions need not be
                    unique, and much interesting work has been generated
                    exploring the deep relationships between different crepant
                    resolutions of a given singularity. A particular heading is
                    provided by Bondal and Orlov's conjecture that any two
                    crepant resolutions of a fixed V/G should have equivalent
