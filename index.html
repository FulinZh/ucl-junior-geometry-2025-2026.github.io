                <p class="schedule-info">(Ruth Wye) A family of quiver varieties</p>
                <p class="schedule-abstract">
                Nakajima quiver varieties (NQVs) are a useful set of varieties to study, as they are irreducible symplectic singularities, so in particular are normal. Therefore, we can learn a lot about other varieties by showing they are isomorphic to an NQV. In this talk, we will look at one particular quiver, and see how varying the stability condition means the NQV is isomorphic to other varieties, including the symmetric product and Hilbert scheme of points on surfaces related to Kleinian singularities. No prior knowledge of quiver varieties will be assumed!

                (Thais Gomes Ribeiro) Hypergeometric structures of invertible pencils of prime chains<p/>
                <p class="schedule-abstract">
                An invertible polynomial is a polynomial with integer coefficients, whose monomials are determined by an invertible matrix. They were classified by Kreuzer and Skarke in terms of three atomic types: chains, loops and Fermats. In this talk, we will deal with a one-parameter deformation of a specific atomic type from two different perspectives: over the complex field and over finite fields. Geometrically, the atomic type chain is the most rigid one. This is because the pencil associated has a trivial diagonal symmetry group. For a prime chain, the triviality of this group is expected to imply that over the complex numbers, all the non-trivial periods of the pencil associated satisfy the same hypergeometric Picard-Fuchs equation. On the other hand, considering the same invertible pencil, but now over a finite field, the triviality of the symmetry group is expected to imply that there is a unique finite field hypergeometric sum determining the point counts, which shares the hypergeometric parameters with the Picard-Fuchs differential operator.  The talk will start with one motivating example, and after that, we will explore a bit of the general case that we are working on now. This is a work in progress and part of it is joint with Adriana Salerno, Eli Orvis, Jessamin Dukes, Leah Sturman, Rachel Davis and Ursula Whitcher.

                (Thibault Langlais) Some observations on the geometry of G2 and Calabi-Yau moduli spaces<p/>
                <p class="schedule-abstract">
                The goal of this talk is to describe certain geometric properties of the moduli spaces of compact manifolds endowed with special holonomy metrics (mostly G2 and SU(3)). By means of motivation, we recall how the Weil-Petersson metric on Calabi—Yau moduli spaces can be studied by Hodge-theoretic methods. We then develop a formally analogous framework to describe the geometry of G2-moduli spaces and mention a few applications.

                <p class="schedule-abstract">
                The appearance of geometric concepts in theoretical physics has been a great boon for geometers, giving us ideas in enumerative geometry, theories of stability conditions, and mirror symmetry. In this butchery of physics, we will focus on derived categories and how they show up in string theory. Starting with an overview of the (perhaps dry) construction of a derived category, we'll slowly spice things up by introducing physical meanings to the mathematical terms. There will be very few pre-requisites: we'll only need vector bundles, some homological algebra and an appreciation for a lack of mathematical&nbsp;rigor.

                (Michael Kohn) Towards a constructive proof of the four colour theorem<p/>
                <p class="schedule-abstract">
                The famous computer-aided proof of the four-colour theorem is somewhat unenlightening. In recent years, research in low-dimensional topology has produced four approaches that may lead to a constructive proof. We will outline one approach  via the study of foams, taking inspiration from their use in sl<sub>n</sub> homology, a generalisation of Khovanov&nbsp;homology.

                (Anisa Hassan) On the topology of the space of rough metrics<p/>
                <p class="schedule-abstract">
                Motivated by numerous applications in PDE and analysis, we define and study the topology of the space of Rough Riemannian Metrics (RRMs) on a fixed smooth manifold M. These metrics generalise Riemannian metrics but are only assumed to be measurable in regularity and may lack smoothness or even continuity. The central object of our considerations is the space of rough metrics, denoted Met(M), equipped with an extended metric dM. We obtain several topological properties of Met(M), starting with completeness. Moreover, we investigate whether every rough Riemannian metric can be approximated by smooth metrics within the rough metric space, and we answer this in the negative. Specifically, we analyze the closure of the subspace of smooth metrics, which turns out to be the space of continuous metrics. Although this space is generally disconnected, we show equivalence classes corresponding to metrics of finite distance via dM are path-connected. These components arise naturally in applications, such as extending results from smooth to rough settings, notably in solving a low-regular Kato square root problem through the invariance of the quadratic estimates. Furthermore, we investigate conditions under which Met(M) becomes connected. In particular, we show that compactness of the manifold M implies the connectedness of the rough metrics space. Remarkably, the converse also holds, providing an alternative criteria to determine compactness of a&nbsp;manifold.

                    singularities</p>

                <p cLass="schedule-abstract">
                    We consider quotient singularities V/G, where V is a
                    finite-dimensional vector space and G is a finite subgroup
                    of SL(V). V/G has a canonical bundle K, and a resolution of
                    singularities f:Y->V/G is crepant if f*K is isomorphic to
                    the canonical bundle on Y. Crepant resolutions need not be
                    unique, and much interesting work has been generated
                    exploring the deep relationships between different crepant
                    resolutions of a given singularity. A particular heading is
                    provided by Bondal and Orlov's conjecture that any two
                    crepant resolutions of a fixed V/G should have equivalent
                    derived&nbsp;categories.

                <p class="schedule-abstract">
                    We will give an introduction to this topic, describing the
                    moduli space of G clusters on V: G-Hilb(V) which often
                    serves as a crepant resolutions in this setting, and which
                    is used to construct various derived equivalences between
                    crepant resolutions in the work of Bridgeland, King, and
                    Reid. We will then describe some new work answering a
                    question of Abramovich in a large number of cases,
                    expanding on recent work of Abdelgadir and Segal, which
                    asks whether there exists an affine variety Z with an
                    action of a reductive group H such that a crepant
                    resolution Y and the Deligne-Mumford stack [V/G] are
                    constructed as GIT quotients of&nbsp;Z.
