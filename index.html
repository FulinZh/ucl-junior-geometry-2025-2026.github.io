        <p>The KCL/UCL Junior Geometry Seminar is a joint seminar of King's
        College London and University College London, presenting topics from
        Algebraic Geometry, Differential Geometry, Geometric Analysis, Geometric
        Group Theory, Topology, and related areas.</p>

        <p>The target audience is young researchers — in particular PhD
        students — with the goal of being <i>useful</i> to those that attend.
        Talks can be introductory, or more advanced. If you would like to see a
        particular topic, or give a talk, please email one of the organizers:

                    Does every compact manifold contain a closed geodesic? This
                    is a classic problem which was first considered by Hadamard
                    and Poincare at the end of the 19th century, but it wasn’t
                    until Birkhoff introduced the idea of a min-max approach
                    that it became tractable in generality. In this talk we’ll
                    look at the geometric measure-theoretic perspective taken
                    by Almgren, Federer, Fleming and many others on this
                    problem, and more importantly on its higher-dimensional
                    generalisations. The bulk of the talk should be accessible
                    to anyone with a little geometric intuition and will be
                    purely expository in nature.

                    style of Batryev-Borisov duality for toric varieties.

                    Pseudo-Anosov flows are a rich class of dynamical systems
                    on three-manifolds. Their behaviour is strongly connected
                    to the topology (think surfaces, foliations) and geometry
                    of the underlying manifold. A fruitful modern development
                    is that these flows are equivalent to a neat combinatorial
                    structure on the manifold: a veering triangulation. We will
                    give an introduction to this correspondence and then
                    discuss some of its applications.

                    The Lickorish-Wallace theorem states that any closed,

                    ±1-surgery on a link in S³. In this talk I will explain
                    what this means and then go through two sketch proofs of
                    this theorem. It will involve talk of Heegaard splittings,
                    Dehn twists and handle decompositions, and plenty of
                    pictures. The aim is for a gentle talk that is accessible
                    to people who haven’t met these concepts before.

                    an application of this theory which proves it’s strength.
                    The basic philosophy is to understand global geometry Fano
                    manifolds via extracting data from family of curves which
                    are “free” to move in some sense. This elegant theory
                    developed by J M Hwang uses techniques from classical
                    projective geometry and differential geometry to study
                    structures of Fano Manifold.

                    We will introduce ultrasolid modules, a variant of the
                    solid modules of Clausen and Scholze, which generalise
                    complete modules over a field k. In this setting, we show
                    some commutative algebra results like an ultrasolid variant
                    of Nakayama's lemma. We also explore higher algebra in the
                    form of animated and E∞ ultrasolid k-algebras. Finally, we
                    will apply this to generalise the Lurie-Schlessinger

                    Marcel Berger classified the list of possible Riemannian
                    holonomy groups in 1955. These correspond to "interesting"
                    geometric structures on Riemannian manifolds. It took
                    almost 40 years to prove that manifolds with these holonomy
                    groups actually exist. Two exceptional groups on this list,
                    G2 and Spin(7), appear only in dimensions 7 and 8,

                    This talk aims to connect three fundamental concepts in
                    algebraic topology: characteristic classes of vector
                    bundles, cobordism theory, and formal group laws. In
                    particular, after giving definitions and examples for each
                    notion, we will see how characteristic classes of a
                    manifold's tangent bundle can be assembled into cobordism
                    invariants, and how the complex cobordism ring encode
                    information about all formal group laws. This perspective
                    reveals deep interconnections between geometry, algebra,
                    and topology.

                    During the early eighties, Freedman classified 4-manifolds
                    up to homeomorphism. This was soon followed by a theorem of
                    Donaldson, which placed strong restrictions on which
                    4-manifolds can have smooth structures. I will explain
                    these theorems and some subsequent constructions of exotic
                    4-manifolds, including exotic R⁴.

                    I will introduce spectral sequences, an extremely useful
                    tool for calculating (co)homology in a variety of settings.
                    I will try not to be technical, but rather illustrate the
                    theory via different examples, including the Serre spectral
                    sequence in topology, the Hodge-to-de-Rham spectral
                    sequence in algebraic geometry and the Morse-Bott spectral
                    sequence in symplectic geometry.

                    The field of geometric group theory focuses on gleaning
                    information about a group G from the metric spaces on which
                    it acts by isometry. In particular, when a group acts on a
                    hyperbolic metric space in a rigid way we call it
                    hyperbolic, and hyperbolic groups have been at the centre
                    of infinite group theory research since the 1990s. In this
                    talk, I will introduce the field of geometric group theory,
                    including demonstrating how to construct a "canonical"
                    metric space corresponding to a group, on which it acts
                    particularly nicely. I will then introduce the definition
                    of hyperbolic groups and discuss some properties of
                    hyperbolic groups that we can see by studying their actions
                    on such canonical spaces.

                <p class="schedule-abstract">
                    We will begin by introducing the moduli space of stable,
                    n-marked, genus zero curves, M_{0,n}, and its
                    compactification. We will then turn our focus to the moduli
                    space, M(x), of relative stable maps to nodal curves, which
                    gives a family of birational models for M_{0,n}. We will do
                    many examples and calculations throughout, with the aim to
                    give you a good feel for these moduli spaces!

                    What is the “best” metric a manifold can admit? While this
                    well depends on your chosen definition of best, this
                    question has driven Riemannian geometers over the last
                    century. During this talk, we will explore different
                    incarnations of this problem. We will focus on the Yamabe
                    problem, the Einstein problem and special
                    holonomy&nbsp;metrics.
